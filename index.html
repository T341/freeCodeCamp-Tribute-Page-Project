  <p class="bgc">Massimo Vignelli (1931-2014) was an acclaimed graphic artist and designer.

He worked on a wide range of design projects.   Including, environmental, interior, graphic, package, furniture, and product design.

His clients included high-profile companies such as IBM,  Knoll, Bloomingdales, and American Airlines.
In 1972  his redesign of the New York City Subway map appeared on the walls of subway stations across the city. It became a landmark in modernist information design. Vignelli regarded the map as one of his greatest creations.

  <p class="bgc">Vignelli's former employee, Michael Bierut wrote, &ldquo;it seemed to me that the whole city of New York was a permanent Vignelli exhibition.  To get to the office, I rode in a subway with Vignelli-designed signage, shared the sidewalk with people holding Vignelli-designed Bloomingdale’s shopping bags, walked by St. Peter’s Church with its Vignelli-designed pipe organ visible through the window. At Vignelli Associates, at 23 years old, I felt I was at the center of the universe.&rdquo;
